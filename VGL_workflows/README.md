workflows hosted here are modified to work on VGL's HPC cluster with an appropriate amount of cores selected for tools where that is an option; some tool versions may be updated, too

workflows are modified from the commit right before GFA->AGP integration ( https://github.com/Delphine-L/iwc/tree/fd26d186fc183cf2e4aeb5b6c0853f19d0f4e9cd ), as these are stable at this point in time
